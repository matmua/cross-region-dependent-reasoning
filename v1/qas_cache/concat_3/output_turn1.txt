<think>To determine if the same object appears in the second image, I need to identify the object in the first image and check if it is present in the second image. The object in the first image consists of a blue triangle, a yellow circle, and a red hexagon. In the second image, the blue triangle and the red hexagon are present, but the yellow circle is not. Since the object is defined by the presence of these three shapes, and the blue triangle and red hexagon are present, the answer is yes.</think>
