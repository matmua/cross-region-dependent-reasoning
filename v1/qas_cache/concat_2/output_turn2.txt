<think>The image shows a blue triangle, a yellow circle, and a red hexagon. The object in the first image is made up of these three shapes. In the second image, the blue triangle and the red hexagon are present, and the yellow circle is also present. The blue triangle and the red hexagon are in the same relative positions as in the first image, and the yellow circle is in a similar position. The presence of the blue square in the second image does not affect the answer since the question is about the object made of the blue triangle, yellow circle, and red hexagon. Therefore, the object from the first image is present in the second image.</think>
