<think>To determine if the same object appears in both images, I need to identify the object in the first image and check if it is present in the second image. The object in the first image is a combination of a blue triangle, a yellow circle, and a red hexagon. In the second image, the blue triangle and the red hexagon are present, and the yellow circle is also present. Therefore, the same object is present in the second image.</think>
